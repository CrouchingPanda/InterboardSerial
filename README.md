# InterboardSerial

Connectivity between [IR thermometer board](https://github.com/CrouchingPanda/Thermometer) and 
its [calibration board](https://github.com/CrouchingPanda/CalibrationBoard).

The DTO is used by [SerialTransfer](https://github.com/PowerBroker2/SerialTransfer) library.

This repo should be cloned to `Libraries` directory so both boards' projects could use it.
